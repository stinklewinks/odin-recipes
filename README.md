# Mia Makes

This app is a present that is dedicated to the homemaking and overall bad-assery of my mother, Lisa. Her grandchildren from my full-blooded sister
call her "Mia". This app will contain all of the recipes that she's known for, new ones she's added, ones that we would like her to make and more. 
She wanted to add places where we can add notes and memories of each recipe and the importance of them to each of us.

I think this will be a fun project! I have had tons of fun so far designing and prototyping everything. I will uploading and sharing the Figma design
files so we can see how the project grows along the way.

## The Gift

### The Website

The main website will be for new comers to enjoy the recipes and projects of Mia. There will be a special Members Only area where family can access
the social aspect of the app.

### The Mobile App

The mobile app will do most of the heavy lifting as far as user interaction is concerned. This is where most family members can add recipes, comment on
current ones and converse with each other.

### The Book

The Mia Compendium will be a major print project that will take place in Adobe InDesign. This will be a tangible gift that can be shared not only with my
mother but other family members as well.
